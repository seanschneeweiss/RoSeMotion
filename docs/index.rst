Its main purpose is to launch AnyBody simulations and collect results. It has a
scheduler to launch multiple instances of AMS utilising computers with multiple
cores. AnyPyTools makes it easy to do parameter and sensitivity and many other
things which is not possible directly within the AnyBody Modeling System.
