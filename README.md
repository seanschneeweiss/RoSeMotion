LeapMotion recording, export to BVH and Anybody
![ROSE Motion](https://snag.gy/T6kpqO.jpg)

## Structure / Actions

* **Record**
Plug in the Leap Motion Controller and make a recording of the right hand
    * **Settings**
        * Setting "Frames per second" defines the minimum time delta between to recorded frames
        * Checking "Animate" will open the bvh animation after recording, a slider can be used to iterate through the frames
        * Setting the basis
    * **BVH Export**
        * Setting "Write BVH-File" will export the recorded motion to a BVH file defined in the next setting
        * Choose the filepath and name in "BVH File"
        * Setting "BVH Channels" will export either the channels XRotation, YRotation, ZRotation or also XPosition, YPosition, ZPosition
    * **Interpolation Vector**
        * Setting "Write interpolation files for AnyBody" will export the files
            * Elbow.any (pronation angle)
            * Finger[1-5].any (angles for all finger joints)
            * FingerLength.any (scaling of the finger lengths based on Leap Motion recording)
            * TimeSeries.any (equally spaced time points between 0 and 1)
            * Wrist.any (abduction and flexion angles for wrist)
        * Choose the template directory, the AnyBody interpolation files are written based on those files
        * Choose the output directory, here the above mentioned files will be saved to
* **AnyBody**
    * **Source files**
        * Choose "exisiting vector files" if interpolation files are already in the project folder <AnyBodyFolder>/Model/InterpolVec
        * Choose ".bvh file" to convert it to the interpolation files based on the templates in config/anybody_templates/ and copy into the AnyBody project folder <AnyBodyFolder>/Model/InterpolVec
        * Choose "Source (.any)" to copy all .any files into the AnyBody project folder <AnyBodyFolder>/Model/InterpolVec
        * Setting "HAND.Main.any" defines the main model file of the AnyBody project, which should be loaded for the analysis
        * Setting "Start Frame" will define the first frame to start with (cut off the frames before that). Leaving this option empty will set the first frame to 1
        * Setting "End Frame" will define the last frame to end with (cut off the frames after that). Leaving this option empty will set the last frame to end
    * **Operations**
        * Select the operations which should be executed in AnyBody
        * Setting "Time steps" will rewrite alls lines which match ``nStep = xx;`` in the main model file. (e.g. ``nStep = 50;``)
    * **Results**
        * Selecting "plot after the analysis" will open an interactive plot for the results from the AnyBody analysis (joint angles)
        * Setting ".anydata.h5 file" will save the results from the AnyBody anaylsis to the specified file
        * Selecting "Open AnyBody" will open the AnyBody GUI after the analysis and will load the .anydata.h5 to make a replay available
* **Converter**
    * Convert a given bvh file to the interpolation files used for AnyBody based on the templates in config/anybody_templates
* **Animation**
    * Open a bvh file to animate it, a slider can be used to iterate through the frames

### Basis setting

* AnyBody initial basis -> select for correct movement within AnyBody
* Leap Motion first frame basis -> select for exporting to BVH and use in other applications

## Setup

**Windows**

* Install python (3.9.1) i.e. from

  https://www.python.org/downloads/
* Add python to system path during setup or follow the following instructions:

  https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb/wiki/Python-&-pip-Windows-installation

* Run in a command prompt:
```
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  pip install -U matplotlib
  pip install -U numpy
  pip install -U pandas
  pip install -U scikit-learn
  pip install -U pywin32
  pip install -U pywinauto
  pip install -U wxpython
  pip install -U scipy
```
Alternative:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
